# Scouting-App-Natives

This repository contains the native method definitons written in C for the scouting app: [https://github.com/TroyNeubauer/Scouting-App](https://github.com/TroyNeubauer/Scouting-App)

Right now, the only native method polls weather or not a new device has been plugged in (requires the Windows API)
